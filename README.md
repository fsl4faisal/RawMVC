JDBC Pain points
=================
Very repititavie code lot of try-finally

one must know sql , and know which sql dialect to speak

entity and sql can get out of sync

table initialization

multiple table initilaization throw exceptions

marshalling and unmarshelling is very clumsy

no transactions..?
joins..?

Servlets pain points
====================
HTTPSrvelt API is restrictive
it's hard to remember where different things were implemented
because they are all if elses

So Far:
	-list all contacts(done)
	-add a contact(done)

To do:
	-view a contact(done)
	-edit a contact(done)
	-delete a contact(done)

====================

Controller/Servlet:
	-ContactServlet
		-doGet=>Display the add contact view 
		-doPost=>add a contact and redirects to contact list
	-ContactListServlet
		-doGet=>Display the contact list view 

Views:
	-add Contact
	-list all contact
